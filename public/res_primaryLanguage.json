    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Stanislav Temelkov. I am a student who seeks development and does everything to achieve his goals. I would say that I am slightly different from the others, but not in the negative. I have participated in the integration of blockchain (Cardano, Cronos, Ravencoin, etc.) to the American platform Cryptoslam. Creating online stores, maintenance, blogging, promoting and advertising web pages and social networks, and many other interesting projects. I have professional experience with Scrum-organized projects through JIRA, TRELLO and etc., AWS clusters, lambda, SQS, SNS, ECS, CloudFormation, EC2 and etc., .NET Framework, ASP.NET MVC, and Web API. I also have a cursory glance with Laravel and Angular. I will do my best to be pleased with myself and I'm sure it will happen. Although I am still a student, I like the profession I study for and want to work in it. I am a fan of remote work(such as there may be business trips or team building) as I think this model of work gives many opportunities for me and employers.",
